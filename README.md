# Project Nexus – ProDev Backend Engineering

Welcome to **Project Nexus**, a key milestone in the **ProDev Backend Engineering (BE) Program**.
This repository is dedicated to documenting major learnings, backend technologies, challenges, solutions, and best practices acquired throughout the program.
It serves as both a **knowledge hub** and a **reference guide** for current and future learners.

---

## Understanding Project Nexus

Project Nexus is the **capstone experience** of the ProDev Backend Engineering program.
It provides an opportunity for learners to demonstrate their ability to apply backend development skills to a **real-world project**.

The goal is to showcase **knowledge, creativity, and technical ability** by building a fully functional backend system.

---

## Objectives of Project Nexus

- Apply backend technologies to a real-world project.
- Design and implement **scalable and efficient backend solutions**.
- Demonstrate problem-solving and critical thinking in **database and API design**.
- Improve collaboration, documentation, and presentation skills.
- Consolidate and document learnings from the program for future reference.

- **Caching Strategies** – Redis, Memcached, and query optimization
- **System Design** – Scalability, load balancing, and fault tolerance
- **Security** – Authentication, authorization, and data protection

---

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Challenge:** Handling long-running tasks in Django

  - ✅ **Solution:** Integrated Celery with RabbitMQ for background processing.
- **Challenge:** Ensuring high API performance under load

  - ✅ **Solution:** Added caching, pagination, and optimized queries.
- **Challenge:** Automating deployment pipelines

  - ✅ **Solution:** Configured GitHub Actions with Docker-based CI/CD workflows.

---

## Best Practices & Takeaways

- Write **clean, modular, and maintainable** code.
- Follow the **12-Factor App principles** for scalable services.
- Use **tests (unit & integration)** and CI pipelines for reliability.
- Prioritize **security, validation, and error handling**.
- Collaboration between frontend and backend teams is essential for success.
